# Hyprland Dotfiles 
[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/J3J01HKVYF)

These are my personal dotfiles for [Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland), focused on performance, clean startup, and a visually cohesive dark aesthetic.

## ✨ What's Included

### 🔧 Systemd User Services

The following components are managed via `systemd --user` for reliable session-based startup and restart:

- **Waybar** – status bar
- **SwayNC** – notification daemon
- **Hypridle** – idle manager (triggers lock and suspend)
- **Hyprpaper** – wallpaper daemon
- **nwg-dock** – dock/panel for quick access

All services use the following structure for proper Hyprland session integration:

```ini
ConditionEnvironment=HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE
After=graphical-session.target
PartOf=graphical-session.target
```

They auto-start with the Hyprland session and terminate cleanly on logout.

## 🎨 Style & Theme

All visual styles are based on the [Dracula color palette](https://draculatheme.com/), applied consistently across components:

- **GTK Theme**: Andromeda (dark)
- **Waybar**: Custom `style.css` themed with Dark colors
- **SwayNC**: Styled with matching accents
- **Hyprpaper**: Uses a dark-themed 3440x1440 wallpaper
- **Font**: JetBrains Mono
- **Icons**: Obsidan Grey

> The result is a seamless, modern, and dark aesthetic across all UI elements.
